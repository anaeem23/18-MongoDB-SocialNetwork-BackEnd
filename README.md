# 18 MongoDB-SocialNetowrk-BackEnd

## Task

To build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. For this, the following were used:
  * Express.js for routing
  * MongoDB database
  * Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and 
  * MomentJS for date formating

Because the application won't be deployed, A walkthough video will be provided. Please see [Submission](#submission)
